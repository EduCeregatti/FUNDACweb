                    <p class="fw-bold h4 text-secondary">Executive Summary</p>
                    <p lang="en-US">&nbsp;The FUNDAC Foundation, is launching the project &quot;Promotion and Dissemination of Art through Digital Media&quot; with the aim of highlighting and increasing visibility for art and artists through digital platforms. This project focuses not only on producing documentaries about the lives of artists but also on fostering the creation of new artistic works in formats such as fiction, documentary, and other narrative forms like drama. FUNDAC promotes the documentary as an art form in its own right and seeks to encourage innovative content that enriches the cultural landscape.</p>
                    <p class="fw-bold h4 text-secondary">Context and Justification</p>
                    <p lang="en-US">In the digital age, online platforms offer a powerful opportunity for art promotion. However, many artists and their works remain unknown or under-recognized. This project addresses this gap by providing a platform for the creation and dissemination of new artistic works in various formats. The proposal moves away from a purely informational approach to documentaries, showcasing them as an important artistic form, and encourages the exploration of new narratives that enhance the cultural panorama in Costa Rica and Latin America.</p>
